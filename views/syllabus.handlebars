        <!-- University Mission Statement Section -->
        <h3>III. University Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>
            Lewis University, guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, provides to a diverse
            student population programs for a liberal and professional education grounded in the
            interaction of knowledge and fidelity in the search for truth.<br><br>
            Lewis promotes the development of the complete person through the pursuit of wisdom
            and justice. Fundamental to its Mission is a spirit of association, which fosters
            community in all teaching, learning and service.<br><br>
        
            <strong>How this course connects to the University Mission:</strong><br>
            This course will allow us to extend our knowledge in software development, provide us
            the foundation for lifelong learning in this domain, and provide us the opportunity to
            assist each other on our learning journey.<br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <!-- Course Materials Section -->
        <h3>IV. Course Materials</h3>

                Using Cloud Computing. ISBN: 978-0984881246.<br><br>

            <strong>E-Learning Headphone with Microphone:</strong> Our blended classroom setting
            requires a wired computer headset with a microphone for both in person and
            online participation.<br><br>

            <strong>Supplemental readings, videos, online materials:</strong> Additional readings, videos, and
            online materials will be provided.<br><br>

            <strong>Hardware and software requirements:</strong> This course requires access to multiple
            software tools. There are generally available for free but will need to be installed and
            utilized from a Windows or Macintosh computer.<br><br>

            <strong>Other required materials or costs:</strong> During this course we will be setting up and utilizing
            GitHub and Microsoft Azure accounts. We will be able to complete course assignments
            utilizing these resources for free or at a very low cost (estimated less than $20). A credit
            card will be needed to sign up for these accounts.<br>

            <strong>Grading Policies:</strong>  No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to
            submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment.<br><br>
            Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that
            has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100%
            of the features partially implemented.<br><br>
            Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale:

        <h3>VIII. Practices and Policies during the Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Responsiveness to Change</strong><br><br>

            Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this
            semester, Lewis University will be guided by our Lasallian mission and the wellbeing of our community of students, faculty, 
            and staff in respond and adapting toany sudden changes or circumstances. Based on the guidance of the State of
            Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be necessary to change the
            planned modality this course.<br><br>

            <strong>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences</strong><br><br>

            Because we are committed to student success, the University community is
            committed to academic standards while maintaining flexibility and empathy.
            Absences relating to the Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused.
            Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that
            impact class attendance and participation should contact their instructor and/or
            college Deanâ€™s Office for assistance. Students directly impacted by Coronavirus
            will have the ability to request alternative grading this semester. Requests will be
            evaluated on a case by case basis and will require documentation.<br><br>

            Students who require academic accommodations due to disability caused by
            COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to Coronavirus, can engage in an
            interactive process with the Learning Access Coordinator to explore all avenues
            for accommodations. Students can contact the Academic Services office at 815-
            836-5593 or learningaccess@lewisu.edu to request an appointment.<br><br>

            <strong>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning</strong><br><br>
            Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain
            physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and
            mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to
            obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While
            the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day,
            cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and
            faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins

            <strong>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations</strong><br><br>
            Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation
            in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would
            like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access
            Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make
            an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing <u style="color:blue">learningaccess@lewisu.edu</u>. Since
            accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is
            recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is
            not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more
            information about academic support services, visit the website at:

            Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for files
            uploaded by instructors. Students can click the down arrow next to any file and select
            Alternative Formats.<br><br>

            <strong>Sanctified Zone</strong><br><br>
            Guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, Lewis University is firmly committed to
            fostering a campus atmosphere that is permeated by its Mission values of Fidelity,
            Wisdom, Knowledge, Justice, and Association. Accordingly, we have declared the
            University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity.
            The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are 
            a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to
            each other. To learn more about the Sanctified Zone, please visit:

            <strong>Academic Integrity</strong><br><br>
            Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other
            forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the
            University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and
            expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially
            considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the
            instructorâ€™s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.
            Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the
            college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases
            except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the
            Provost makes the final decision.<br><br>
